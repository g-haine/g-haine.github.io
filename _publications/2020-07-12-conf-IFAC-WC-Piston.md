In this study, the modelling of the boundary-controlled 1D piston problem as the interconnection of simpler port-Hamiltonian systems (pHs) is addressed. More precisely, two viscous compressible fluids are separated by a moving rigid body on a bounded domain \\((0, L)\\). Thermodynamics is taken into account, leading to two pHs for each physical domain: one associated to the kinetic energy and the other one to the internal energy. No chemical reaction is being considered in the system. A control by mass injection/rejection and heating is then applied at the left end of the first fluid.
