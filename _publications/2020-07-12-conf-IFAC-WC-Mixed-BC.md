The propagation of acoustic waves in a 2D geometrical domain under mixed boundary control is here described by means of the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formalism. A finite element based method is employed to obtain a consistently discretized model. To construct a model with mixed boundary control, two different methodologies are detailed: one employs Lagrange multipliers, the other relies on a virtual domain decomposition to interconnect models with different causalities. The two approaches are assessed numerically, by comparing the Hamiltonian and the state variables norm for progressively refined meshes.
