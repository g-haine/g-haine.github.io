A structure-preserving partitioned finite element method (PFEM), for the semi-discretization of infinite-dimensional explicit port-Hamiltonian systems (pHs), is extended to those pHs of implicit type, leading to port-Hamiltonian differential Algebraic Equations (pH-DAE). Two examples are dealt with: the nonlocal vibrations in a viscoelastic nanorod in 1D, and the dynamics of a fluid filtration model, the Dzektser seepage model in 2D, for which illustrative numerical simulations are provided.
