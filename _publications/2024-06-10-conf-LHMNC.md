The Python package SCRIMP (Simulation and ContRol of Interactions in Multi-Physics) is presented through a collection of port-Hamiltonian systems (pHs) of increasing complexity, stemming from mechanics and thermodynamics. A focus is made on the syntax of SCRIMP allowing the user to easily describe a distributed pHs and its discretization method using the Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM) in space, together with the Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) solver to use. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is presented.
