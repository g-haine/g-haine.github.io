We propose to use the observer-based algorithm of Ramdani, Tucsnak and Weiss (Automatica, 2010) for the initial state recovery of the wave equation involved in thermoacoustic tomography. We proved the rate of convergence of the iterative algorithm to the observable part of the initial state. We performed 3D numerical test in the relevant case where the measurement is performed on a grid of transducers on a half-sphere.
