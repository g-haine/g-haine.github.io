In this work, we detail a procedure to construct a reduced order model on the basis of frequency-domain data, that preserves the non-strictly passive property and the port-Hamiltonian structure. The proposed scheme is based on Benner et al. contribution (2020), which has been adapted (i) to handle non-strictly passive model, and (ii) to handle numerical issues observed when applying the Loewner framework on complex configurations. We validate the proposed scheme on a very complex two-dimensional wave equation, for which the discretized version preserves the port-Hamiltoninan form.
