The modelling and discretization of the boundary controlled 3D Maxwell's equations as a port-Hamiltonian system is addressed. The proposed scheme, based on the Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM), originally proposed in Cardoso-Ribeiro et al. (2018), preserves the Dirac structure at the discrete level. Two types of damping phenomena are taken into account: Joule's effect, and a matrix-valued impedance at the boundary, both being preserved by PFEM, as presented in Serhani et al. (2019).
