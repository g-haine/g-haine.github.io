This work demonstrates the discretization of the boundary-controlled Maxwell equations, recast as a port-Hamiltonian system (pHs). After a reminder on the Stokes-Dirac structure associated with the Maxwell system, we introduce different partitioned weak formulations that preserve the pHs structure, and its associated power balance, at the semi-discrete level. These weak formulations are compared through numerical applications to closed non-perfectly conducting cavities and open waveguides under transverse approximation.
