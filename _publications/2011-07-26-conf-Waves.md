A new iterative algorithm for solving initial data inverse problems from partial observations has been recently proposed in Ramdani, Tucsnak and Weiss (Automatica, 2010). In this work, we are concerned with the convergence analysis of this algorithm. We provide a complete numerical analysis for a fully discrete approximation derived using finite elements in space and finite differences in time. We present these results in the case of wave conservative systems with locally distributed observation and conclude with a numerical example.
